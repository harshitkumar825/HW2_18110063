Q1_Q2_Q3.pdf contains handwritten scanned solutions for the first 3 questions.

Q4_code.py may require additional packages to be installed. Obtained result in plot and tabular form have been provided.
For CM sketch, d<=40 will definitely give an avg. error below 1%.
For CS sketch and Misra-Gries sketch, d<=20 will definitely give an avg. error below 1%.

Q5_code.py may require additional packages to be installed. Obtained plot has been provided.
The baseline algorithm appears to work much better than the low-rank approximation algorithm.
Probably because linear regression gives a good fit, while low rank approximations of sparse high dimensional matrices will have mostly 0's and predict useless values.

All required datasets are in the repository itself.
